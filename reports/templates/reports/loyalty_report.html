                The Loyalty Program report identifies valuable clients who have made significant purchases in the previous month. 
                These are clients with total purchases exceeding 5,000,000 COP during the previous calendar month.
            </p>
            <p>
                This report provides a list of all loyalty-eligible clients along with their contact information and total purchases amount.
                It helps our company identify and reward our most valuable customers.
